\section{Introduction} 
During the last sprints/weeks, our project has been divided into three separate sub-projects. These are the GAMYGDALA port, GOAL plugin and the GOALGAMYGDALA interface. This is why this report has three sections, containing an explanation for all the sub-projects. \\ \par
During the last weeks we have improved, expended and updated this report so that it became more complete. In this document there will be a overview of the sub-projects with their systems. The systems will be explained by using UML diagrams, Design patterns and explaining the uses of the systems.
