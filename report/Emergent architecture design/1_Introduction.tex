\section{Introduction}
This is the draft version of our emergent architecture design. We just programming this week. During the first sprints/weeks, our project is divided in two separate sub-projects. These are the GAMYGDALA port and the Goal plugin. This is why this report has two sections, containing an explanation for both sub-projects. \\ \par
During the next weeks will keep improving, expending and updating this report so that it becomes more complete. We also think that we will combine this report with the emergent architecture designs of the other groups within our context project.
