\section{Introduction} 
During the last sprints/weeks, our project has been divided into three separate sub-projects. These are the GAMYGDALA port, the GOAL plugin and the GOALGAMYGDALA interface. These projects work together to create the complete product. Because of this division, this report has three sections, containing an explanation for all the sub-projects.

During the last weeks we have improved, expended and updated this report so that it became more complete. In this document there will be a overview of the sub-projects with their systems. The systems will be explained by using UML diagrams, Design patterns and explaining the uses of the systems.
