\textbf{ga-appraise}(double \emph{likelihood}, string \emph{agent}, list \emph{affectedGoals},\\list \emph{goalCongruences}, boolean \emph{isIncremental})

Appraises a belief that influences the likelihoods of goals. This is how agents gain emotions.\\

\begin{tabular}{l l}
	\textbf{likelihood} & The likelihood of the belief to be true.\\
	\textbf{agent} & The agent that caused the belief. \\
	\textbf{affectedGoals} & The goals that were affected.\\
	\textbf{goalCongruences} & How the goals were affected respectively, from -1\\ 
	& to 1, -1 for very negatively, 1 for very positively. \\
	\textbf{likelihood} & The likelihood of the belief to be true.\\
	\textbf{isIncremental} & Whether this belief enforces the likelihood of \\
	& these goals (\textit{true}), or defines the absolute likelihood (\textit{false}).
