\textbf{ga-appraise}(double \emph{likelihood}, string \emph{agent}, list \emph{affectedGoals},\\list \emph{goalCongruences}, boolean \emph{isIncremental})

Appraises a belief that influences the likelihoods of goals. This is how agents gain emotions.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{likelihood} \\ The likelihood of the belief to be true.
	\item \textbf{agent} \\ The agent that caused the belief.
	\item \textbf{affectedGoals} \\ The goals that were affected.
	\item \textbf{goalCongruences} \\ How the goals were affected respectively, from -1 to 1, -1 for very negatively, 1 for very positively.
	\item \textbf{isIncremental} \\ Whether this belief enforces the likelihood of these goals (true), or defines the absolute likelihood (false).
\end{itemize}
