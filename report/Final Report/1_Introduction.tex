\section{Introduction}
This report is the final project report for Group 4 of the Virtual Humans for Serious Gaming Contextproject. The main goal of this project was to make a virtual human that could replace an actual human in the Tygron \citep{tygron} urban planning game. This virtual human should be able to play the game like it is a real human, this includes making rational choices as well as making choices based on emotions. For an in-depth description of our customers and their requirements, please read our Product Vision \citep{vision}. \\ \par
The focus of our group was on making the emotion part of the virtual human. In this report you can find how we made this emotional part, you can also find a description of the software engineering aspect as well as the interaction design, the failure analysis and an outlook in what is next.
