\section{Developed functionalities}
It is essential for Non-Playable Characters (NPC) in games to have and feel emotions. Emotions are crucial in respect to gameplay decisions, especially in serious games. The virtual human to which we contribute with this project has to be able be affected by actions outside it's own influence, and feel emotions. Therefore, we have tried to find a way to use GAMYGDALA \citep{gamygdala} in GOAL.

\subsection{Gamygdala in GOAL}
The primary goal of the GOAL programming language is to allow people to program agents from a human point of view, so that they can simulate human behaviour with ease. GOAL is very good at modelling the logical side of humans, but it lacks the very reason for our right brain's existence: Emotion. To allow GOAL to support this vital part of human simulation, we have added GAMYGDALA functionality to GOAL. All actions that are available in GAMYGDALA are now also available in goal. Using the GAMYGDALA plugin, agents can do the following things:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Tell GAMYGDALA it has a goal.
	\item Tell GAMYGDALA it no longer has a goal.
	\item Appraise an event. This is what makes it gain emotions.
	\item Establish a relationship with another agent.
	\item Recalculate the emotions based on the passage of time.
\end{itemize}
Using these actions, programmers can completely take emotion into account while programming agents that need to mimic human behaviour.
