\section{Product Backlog}
In this section you can find the product backlog for our part of the project. It is made using the MoSCoW method.

\subsection{User stories of features}
\paragraph{Must have} 
\begin{itemize}
\item There needs to be a fully functional port for GAMYGDALA to Java.
\item The GAMYGDALA plugin needs to work in GOAL.
\item The plugin must work without fatal problems.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Should have} 
\begin{itemize}
\item The plugin should work efficient, so that the programmer won't notice the calculation time.
\item The plugin should work without any errors or failures. 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Could have} 
\begin{itemize}
\item There could be a plugin framework for GOAL, so that new plugins can easily be added.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Won't have} 
\begin{itemize}
\item There won't be new customizable emotions in GAMYGDALA on initialization of the plugin.
\item There won't be automatic usage of the plugin. The programmer needs to use the plugin manually 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User stories of technical improvements}
\paragraph{Must have} 
\begin{itemize}
\item The code must be implemented according to the Software Engineering principals.

\item There must be unit tests as well as integration tests.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Should have} 
\begin{itemize}
\item There should be proper Javadoc for the code.
\item The code should pass the checkstyle demands.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Could have} 
\begin{itemize}
\item There could be a higher overall test percentage.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Won't have} 
\begin{itemize}
\item There won't be an improvement over the standard GOAL framework.
\item The functionality of GAMYGDALA will not be changed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User stories of know-how acquisition}

\item We must obtain knowledge about interactive design.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Should have} 
\begin{itemize}
\item We should have a global understanding of the other parts of this project.
\item We should have an understanding of the GOAL programming language.
\item We should have a good understanding of Git/GitHub.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Could have} 
\begin{itemize}
\item We could obtain knowledge about EIS.
\item We could obtain general knowledge about emotions in AI.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Won't have} 
\begin{itemize}

\item We won't obtain knowledge about other programming languages then the ones used in the plugin.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Initial release plan}
Our project is divided in three separate parts. We started by finding out what was expected from us and how we could start at working on the final product (getting an understanding of the GOAL programming language code). Then we ported GAMYGDALA to Java. The final and biggest part of this project is designing and implementing the final plugin using the previously acquired knowledge.
