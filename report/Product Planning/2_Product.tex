\section{Product}
\subsection{High-level Product Backlog}
We as a group are part of the bigger context project, which consists of four groups that all work on a different part of the final product. Our part of this final product is making a GAMYGDALA plugin for the GOAL programming language. To achieve this, we first need to get a good understanding of the GOAL programming language. Then we need to find out how we can make a (simple) plugin for GOAL. We also need to have a certain understanding of how GAMYGDALA works, so we can port GAMYGDALA to Java. Then we need to bring it all together so we can create a working GAMYGDALA plugin for GOAL. \\ \par
Our final plugin will be used by the other groups to make a virtual human for the Tygron engine. You can see the Product View for an elaborate description of our user and the final product.

\subsection{Roadmap}
In this subsection, you can find a global planning per sprint.
